# 505 Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Memory and CPU Allocation**
- **Problem**: Application was running out of memory (1Gi limit) causing worker timeouts
- **Fix**: Increased memory to 2Gi and CPU to 2 cores
- **File**: `cloudbuild.yaml`

### 2. **Docker Build Issues**
- **Problem**: Frontend directory was excluded in `.dockerignore`
- **Fix**: Commented out the frontend exclusion line
- **File**: `.dockerignore`

### 3. **Database Connection Optimization**
- **Problem**: No connection pooling and optimization for production
- **Fix**: Added database connection settings with pooling
- **File**: `backend/event_management/settings.py`

### 4. **Gunicorn Configuration**
- **Problem**: Suboptimal worker configuration causing memory issues
- **Fix**: Changed to single worker with 4 threads, increased timeout to 300s
- **File**: `Dockerfile.production`

### 5. **Dependencies Conflict**
- **Problem**: Both `psycopg2` and `psycopg2-binary` were installed causing build failure
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate `psycopg2` dependency
- **File**: `backend/requirements-production.txt`

### 6. **Template Configuration**
- **Problem**: Django couldn't find the React build template
- **Fix**: Added templates directory to Django settings
- **File**: `backend/event_management/settings.py`

### 7. **Static Files Configuration**
- **Problem**: Static files not properly configured for production
- **Fix**: Added static file finders and proper configuration
- **File**: `backend/event_management/settings.py`

### 8. **Health Check Endpoint**
- **Problem**: Health check was pointing to a non-existent endpoint
- **Fix**: Changed to `/api/` endpoint
- **File**: `Dockerfile.production`

## Current Status

âœ… **Application is now working correctly:**
- Root endpoint returns 200 OK
- API endpoint returns 401 (expected - requires authentication)
- Admin endpoint returns 302 redirect (expected - requires login)
- No more 505 errors or memory issues
